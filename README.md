# Constraints of this script
Before learning about how to use this script, here are the constraints of each site that are accounted for: <br>
<li>
    <ol>Has at most 5 people </ol>
    <ol>Has at max 1 staff member who is NOT a Site Leader </ol>
    <ol>Has 1 site leader and 1 driver(not necessarily mutually exclusive)<ol>
</li>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Instructions on how to use this script
<ol>

# Notes
<ol>
    <li> You can move this entire folder elsewhere on your PC. Just keep in mind that the "cd" command is used to get to the relevant directory.</li>
    <li>During the installation of Python, make sure to add it to PATH. This option will be provided during installation</li>
    <li>The command "python3 main.py" is based on the fact that the current python version is 3.10. Change the command accordingly to reflect the name of the python application that you have.</li>
    <li>If you're looking to adjust the script to account for different conditions of what makes up a site, the code is documented and I tried to make the variable names as intuitive as possible. But, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.</li>
